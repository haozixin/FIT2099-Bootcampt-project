(integer type advantages / string disadvantages):

Although 
we can assign ID automatically when ID data type is "int" but String cannot do that .(for example, increasing 1 for every creation)



(integer type disadvantages / string advantages):

I prefer to use String as ID data type.
Because
1. "int" is not safe enough when comparing "String". Sometimes, it will loss accuracy when it is too long(too big). Also, since a string is immutable, its value is immutable in java so that String is more safe.
2. String can save any character, number, special signiture, so, it is more convenient when your ID is not just consisted of number.
