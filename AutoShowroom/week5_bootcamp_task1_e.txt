Advantages for throwing approach:

1.Throwing an exception is the only clean way to report an error from a constructor.
2. Obviously, this approach alerts the caller of the method to possible exception conditions so that the caller can handle them appropriately.

Disadvantages for throwing approach:
1. One disadvantage of exception handling is that it is difficult to adopt a good error handling strategy. Exceptions such as recovery from low capacity memory state, 
write errors, and algorithm errors are not easily resolved.

Advantages for static public method:

1. It can improve the quality of code by making the code more readable, less coupled, and improves performance by caching.
2. It gives you a lot more flexibility when it comes time to change the application (i.e. you can create new implementations without changing the dependent code)

Disadvantages for static public method:

1. once you make the constructor private to ensure that the class can only be instantiated using the constructor, you lost the power of inheritance 
because classes without public or protected constructor cannot be extended.
